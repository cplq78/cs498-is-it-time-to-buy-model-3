    <h3>Full Self-Driving Analysis</h3>
    <p> Another selling point in Tesla Model 3s is the Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability.
        At an article published by Electrek, they stated that "Elon Musk evaluated the complete
        version of the FSD package at over $100,000."
        As we can note on the graph the price, the price has seen some fluctuation. However, the price
        has gotten to 10 percent of Musk's evaluation.
        <b>The lowest cost for the feature was $6,000</b>, from early April/2019 to mid August/2019.
        </br>Currently, the FSD feature is priced at $8,000.
