    <h3>Overall Cost Analysis</h3>
    <p>For a while now, the Tesla Model 3 has been one of the most technologically advanced vehicles in
        the market. From YouTube videos to web blogs, current owners praise, and at times express their
        dislikes, the fully electric vehicle that is safe, can drive itself, looks futuristic, receives over-the-air
        software updates, among others.
        </br> As we've seen, there has been some price fluctuation for the Model 3 Dual motor (AWD), and the FSD.
        According to the Overall Cost graph, the total cost for the car has come down. Since mid August/19
        the prices have remained virtually the same. <b>As of August 1, 2020, the overall cost is $54,990.</b>
        </br>So, if you are in the market for a new vehicle, or just contemplating purchasing
        a Model 3, this may be the time.
