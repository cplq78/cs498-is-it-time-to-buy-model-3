    <h3>Vehicle Price Analysis</h3>
    <p>As we can see from the graph price history below, this particular model configuration has seen
        some variability with its price. With vehicles being delivered starting late July/18, we can see
        that those vehicles came with a price of $54,000 without adding any ‘add ons,’ such as upgraded
        tires, or colors. Starting early September/2018, the price went up by $1,000 for a total of
        $55,000, the highest we have ever seen. However, <b>from October/2018 to mid March/2019,
            the price has dropped $8,000.</b> Bringing the vehicle cost to $47,000, the lowest we have seen up to then.
